ipy-progressbar allows to use the same code for rich progressbars in IPython Notebooks, and for simple fallback ones in terminal sessions.


Example
=======

Code like this:

    from ipy_progressbar import ProgressBar

    pb = ProgressBar(10, title='Outer', key='outer')
    for i in pb:
        pb_inner = ProgressBar(5, title='Inner', key='inner')
        for j in pb_inner:
            # inner loop body

will work both in IPython Notebook and in plain console. When run in notebook, the output will be rich (Bootstrap progress bars), while console version is mainly thought of as a fallback.
